* Installation
- It's a tricky business to install Caffe on OS-X. To get it installed
  on a Macbook, I had to do the following extra steps, next to the
  official installation instructions.
  - It's critical to have all paths set correctly.
  - Make sure to use exactly 1 version of python, from homebrew, or
    anaconda. I tried it first with anaconda, but it didn't work out
    for (was able to compile everthing and run through tests, but the
    import of caffe in python caused a seg.fault.)
